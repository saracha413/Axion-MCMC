# Axion-MCMC
Modified MCMC using information theory rather than Bayesian analysis to evaluate an early dark energy model that uses a scalar field potential motivated with an axionic form. 

This project does not work yet! A functional, limited parameter space MCMC is in TheGoldenMCMC.py. Other files are miscellaneous statistics and analysis in various stages of completeness (and may be buggy).
